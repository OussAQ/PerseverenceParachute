# 🚀 Perseverence's Parachute Secret Message Encoder
Inspired by the binary coding of NASA's Perseverance rover parachute, I developed a Qt-based C++ application that functions as a secret message encoder. The application transforms text inputs into innovative geometric patterns, offering unique circular and binary visualizations of the encoded data.

## 🧠 About the Project

This project is a **Qt-based application** developed as part of an engineering school assignment.  
It simulates and analyzes **parachute deployment**, including physics calculations, UI display, and real-time parameter visualization.

Key focuses include:

- Modeling parachute geometry  
- Real-time simulation with Qt  
- UI design using Qt Widgets  
- Collaboration and version control  
- Engineering problem-solving workflow

## ✨ Features

-  **Interactive GUI** built with Qt  
-  **Parachute deployment simulation**  
-  **Live visualization** of forces & trajectory  
-  Clean project structure with modular C++ classes  
-  Cross-platform support (Linux, Windows, macOS)
